# PART V

**Quantum Computing**

*The Foam's Own Mechanics Harnessed*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

Quantum computers exploit superposition, entanglement and interference
to perform computations intractable for classical machines. Standard
quantum mechanics describes these phenomena precisely but provides no
physical picture of what is happening in the substrate. The foam model
provides that picture --- and makes one specific quantitative
prediction.

**I. Superposition --- Unimprinted Foam Structure**

A qubit in superposition is a topological foam structure that has not
yet created a void-pair imprint in the environment. The displacement
event exists but the foam has not recorded which state it settled into.
The superposition is real --- a genuine physical ambiguity in the local
foam structure, not mathematical bookkeeping. Measurement is any
physical interaction that creates a void-pair imprint. The superposition
ends not because of mystical collapse but because the foam now carries a
record.

> remember. Measurement is the foam being asked to remember.*

**II. Entanglement --- Void-Pair Connectivity**

Entangled qubits are endpoints of shared displacement events ---
void-pairs. The two qubits are not separate objects that happen to be
correlated. They are two addresses of one foam structure. Operations on
one qubit manipulate the displacement event D, which simultaneously
changes the state at the other address. The processor is not passing
signals between qubits. It is manipulating the topology of a connected
void-pair network.

**III. Gate Operations --- Resonant Foam Wave Coupling**

In real quantum computers qubits are controlled by high energy wave
patterns at precisely the qubit's resonant frequency --- microwave
pulses for superconducting qubits, laser pulses for trapped ions. The
standard description calls this rotating the Bloch sphere --- a
mathematical abstraction. The foam model identifies the physical
mechanism beneath that abstraction.

A qubit at rest is a stable topological foam configuration --- a
standing wave at resonant frequency f₀. A gate operation introduces a
wave packet at the same frequency f₀. The driving wave couples
resonantly to the standing wave. Energy transfers. The topology shifts.
The qubit's state changes. The standard gate mathematics:

**theta = integral A(t) * cos(2*pi*f_0*t) dt (1)**

is the linearised description of this non-linear foam resonance in the
small-amplitude limit. A(t) is the amplitude of the driving foam wave.
The integral accumulates the phase shift as the wave reshapes the
topology. Gate errors arise from noise in the wave pattern --- physical
distortion of the driving foam wave causing imprecise topology
reshaping.

**IV. Quantum Interference --- The Double Slit at Computational Scale**

Quantum algorithms work by setting up interference patterns across
computational paths --- amplifying paths to correct answers by
constructive interference, cancelling paths to wrong answers by
destructive interference. This is the double slit experiment operating
at the scale of a computation. Each computational path creates a foam
wake. The wakes interfere. The correct answer is the bright fringe.

A quantum computer is not magic. It is a precisely engineered
interference device --- a sophisticated application of the same foam
wake mechanics that produces double slit patterns. The engineering
challenge is maintaining foam coherence long enough for the interference
to complete.

**V. Decoherence --- Void-Pair Imprinting by the Environment**

Every stray photon, thermal vibration, or electromagnetic fluctuation
that touches a qubit creates a void-pair imprint --- a physical record
of the qubit's state. Once recorded in the foam, the superposition
ends. Engineers shield qubits at 15 millikelvin and ultra-high vacuum to
prevent environmental foam perturbations. Every shielding measure is, in
foam terms, preventing void-pair imprints from forming.

**VI. The Gravitational Prediction --- A Precision Physics Test**

The foam's decoherence prediction implies that coherence times are
longer at higher gravitational potential. Numerically:

**delta_tau / tau = 2 * delta_phi = 8.22 x 10^-11 (Earth surface vs
ISS) (2)**

> *✓ phi_surface = 6.961e-10, phi_ISS = 6.550e-10, delta = 4.11e-11,
> fractional improvement = 8.22e-11.*

**Superconducting qubits (1ms coherence): 0.08 picoseconds
[unmeasurable]**

**Trapped ion qubits (100s coherence): 8.2 nanoseconds [marginally
measurable]**

This is not a practical engineering advantage. It is a fundamental
physics test. If the prediction is correct, identical trapped ion
systems at different altitudes should show coherence time differences of
approximately 8 nanoseconds per 100 seconds of nominal coherence. A null
result would constrain the foam model. A positive result at the correct
magnitude would be significant evidence for vacuum density variation
with gravitational potential.

**VII. Quantum Computing as the Next Feedback Loop**

Life is the foam developing instruments to know itself. The feedback
loop has passed through chemical sensing, neural modelling, language,
classical computation. Each stage adds resolution --- a more accurate
model of the foam's structure. Classical computing operates entirely in
the emergent linear layer, manipulating void-pair imprints at
macroscopic scales.

Quantum computing is qualitatively different. It operates by the foam's
own pre-imprint dynamics --- superposition, entanglement, interference.
It does not model the foam from the linear averaged surface. It reaches
into the substrate and uses the substrate's own mechanics. It is the
first computational instrument that operates below the linear
approximation rather than within it.

The hard problems of biology, medicine, climate and consciousness are
non-linear foam structures. Classical computers model these by
linearising them. Quantum computers can explore the full non-linear
landscape by superposition --- holding all possibilities simultaneously
until interference selects the correct answer. This is not a speed
improvement. It is access to a dimension of the problem that classical
computation cannot reach.
