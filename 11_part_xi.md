**Elemental Resonance and Interference Angles**

*Frequencies, Foam Topology, and the Spiral Periodic Table*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

Terrence Howard has proposed that elements can be manipulated using
frequencies at specific angles, organised according to a spiral
arrangement of the periodic table. This section examines that
proposition through the UFFT framework --- what is mathematically
derivable, what is consistent with established physics, and what remains
to be experimentally confirmed.

**I. Every Element is a Foam Topology**

In UFFT every element is a stable composite topological foam structure.
Protons and neutrons are tightly bound foam vortex clusters at the
nuclear scale (~10⁻¹⁵ m). Electrons are standing foam waves in orbital
shells at progressively larger radii (a₀ = 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m for hydrogen
ground state, scaling as n²·a₀ for shell n). The atom as a whole is a
composite resonant structure --- each shell a distinct foam topology at
a distinct scale.

Each element therefore has real natural resonant frequencies. These are
not hypothetical --- they are the spectral lines already measured by
physics. In foam terms they are the natural oscillation frequencies of
each shell's standing wave topology. The spectral lines of hydrogen are
verified by the Bohr model and confirmed numerically:

**f(n1→n2) = R_inf * c * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)**

> *✓ Hydrogen transitions: n=1→2 at 121.54 nm (2.47e15 Hz), n=2→3 at
> 656.34 nm (4.57e14 Hz), n=3→4 at 1875.24 nm (1.60e14 Hz). All
> confirmed.*

For heavier elements, K-alpha X-ray frequencies follow Moseley's Law
--- scaling as (Z-1)² --- reflecting how nuclear charge tightens the
foam topology of inner shells as proton count increases.

**II. The Spiral Table --- Structure, Frequencies, and the Octave
Series**

**The Core Observation**

Terrence Howard's claim, stated precisely (JRE #2152): hydrogen,
carbon, silicon, and cobalt share the same colour on the spectrometer
and the same tone, just doubled with each octave. He left college in
chemical engineering over this observation --- that the professor said
each element is a fixed isolated entity, and Howard replied: you don't
see the relationship.

The specific frequencies Howard states:

**Hydrogen Z=1 40.5 Hz [base frequency --- Octave 0]**

**Carbon Z=6 81.0 Hz [× 2 --- Octave 1]**

**Silicon Z=14 162.0 Hz [× 4 --- Octave 2]**

**Cobalt Z=27 324.0 Hz [× 8 --- Octave 3]**

**Rhodium Z=45 648.0 Hz [× 16 --- Octave 4]**

Each step is exactly one octave --- a doubling. Howard: "Same tone,
same key of E. 40.5. Next one would be 81 Hz. You go to silicon, it
doubles to 162 Hz. You go to cobalt and it's 324 Hz."

> assignment are Howard's stated empirical values. Their derivation
> from first principles is not yet established in UFFT. The doubling
> relationship is consistent with the foam topology analysis below, but
> the absolute base is not derived here.*

**Why These Elements --- The Noble Gas Midpoint Structure**

The structural reason why H, C, Si, Co, Rh form a connected series is
not arbitrary. Every one of them sits at the exact midpoint between two
consecutive noble gas closed shells:

**(pre-He) → Hydrogen Z=1 → He Z=2**

**He Z=2 → Carbon Z=6 → Ne Z=10**

**Ne Z=10 → Silicon Z=14 → Ar Z=18**

**Ar Z=18 → Cobalt Z=27 → Kr Z=36**

**Kr Z=36 → Rhodium Z=45 → Xe Z=54**

In UFFT: noble gases are fully closed foam shell topologies --- every
orbital filled, no topological flexibility, no reactivity. The element
at the midpoint between two noble gases has exactly half-filled shells.
It is at maximum topological openness --- equidistant from two stable
closed configurations. This is why carbon can bond with virtually
everything. This is why silicon underpins all semiconductor technology.
This is why cobalt is biologically and magnetically active. They are not
different substances. They are the same topological condition ---
maximum foam shell openness --- at progressively larger scales.

Howard: "Those things don't really exist as separate entities. It's
only one substance. The first thing we're able to perceive is hydrogen.
Before it is too dense for us to perceive."

In UFFT terms: the series H→C→Si→Co→Rh is one topological pattern ---
half-filled foam shell --- recurring at each successive shell scale.
They are the same foam condition at different radii, as Howard states.

> midpoint positions confirmed: Z=1 midpoint of 0-2, Z=6 midpoint of
> 2-10, Z=14 midpoint of 10-18, Z=27 midpoint of 18-36, Z=45 midpoint of
> 36-54.*

**The Carbon Octave --- Internal Structure and Matched Pairs**

Carbon is the midpoint element of the octave running from He (Z=2) to Ne
(Z=10). Howard calls it the bisexual tone because carbon sits at the
centre with both +4 and -4 valence --- it can bond as either electron
donor or acceptor.

**He Z=2 ← closed boundary**

**Li Z=3 +1 valence**

**Be Z=4 +2 valence**

**B Z=5 +3 valence**

**C Z=6 ±4 valence ← centre --- bisexual tone**

**N Z=7 -3 valence**

**O Z=8 -2 valence**

**F Z=9 -1 valence**

**Ne Z=10 ← closed boundary**

The matched pairs are elements equidistant from carbon --- they carry
equal and opposite valence charges:

**Li (Z=3) ↔ F (Z=9) [±3 from C --- bond readily]**

**Be (Z=4) ↔ O (Z=8) [±2 from C --- bond readily]**

**B (Z=5) ↔ N (Z=7) [±1 from C --- bond readily]**

Howard: "This means Lithium will match with Fluorine. Oxygen with
Beryllium, and Nitrogen with Boron. They are natural mates and will
break any bond to be together."

This is correct valence chemistry. The symmetry is real and measurable.
In UFFT terms: each pair consists of two foam topologies at equal but
opposite distances from the closed-shell boundary. Li is one foam unit
above the He closed shell. F is one unit below the Ne closed shell. They
are topological mirrors of each other --- and mirror topologies bond
because together they produce a closed configuration. The chemical
observation and the foam geometric description are the same statement.

This internal structure repeats in every octave. The silicon octave (Ne
to Ar) has the same matched pair pattern centred on silicon. The cobalt
octave (Ar to Kr) has the same pattern centred on cobalt, which is why
cobalt sits at the centre of the first-row transition metals and is
biologically essential (vitamin B12).

> bonded compounds reflecting the predicted affinity. Carbon's ±4
> valence is textbook chemistry.*

**The Spiral Geometry --- Why a Spiral, Not a Rectangle**

The standard periodic table is a rectangle. Howard and Walter Russell
(whose spiral table was copyrighted in 1926 in The Universal One) argue
this representation loses the continuity of the relationships. In UFFT
the reason is structural: foam shells expand outward continuously. Each
new shell wraps around the previous one. This is spiral geometry --- not
a grid.

The rectangular table breaks the series H→C→Si→Co→Rh apart, placing them
in different rows with no visible connection. The spiral places them at
the same angular position in successive turns --- making the topological
identity visible geometrically. Howard: "It's like wrapping a rag
around your hand. The first wrap is so tight. As you go outward the
wraps get larger but they're still the same motion."

The period lengths --- 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32 elements --- correspond to
the orbital filling of each shell. In spiral geometry these become the
angular width of each turn. Elements at the same angle in successive
turns share the same shell topology position. Elements at the same angle
are the same foam condition at a larger scale.

> *✓ Period angular spacings: Period 1 (2 elements): 180°/element.
> Periods 2-3 (8 elements): 45°/element. Periods 4-5 (18 elements):
> 20°/element. Periods 6-7 (32 elements): 11.25°/element. Consistent
> with shell filling.*

**Elements as Pressure Conditions**

Howard: "Elements are periodic pressure conditions rather than fixed
entities, with matter arising from the interplay of electricity
(centripetal force) and magnetism (centrifugal force)."

UFFT: Elements are stable resonant foam topologies --- standing wave
structures in the Planck-density foam medium. The
centripetal/centrifugal language maps directly to the inward foam
pressure (centripetal) and the topological expansion pressure of a
standing wave (centrifugal). These are different vocabularies for the
same physical picture.

The practical consequence: if elements are pressure conditions rather
than fixed particles, then changing the local pressure and geometry
changes what element exists at that location. This is the basis of the
transmutation claim --- not alchemy in the mystical sense, but resonant
pressure manipulation of a foam topology.

**III. The Interference Angle Formula**

Two coherent beams at wavelength lambda crossing at angle theta create a
standing wave with spatial fringe spacing:

**d_fringe = lambda / (2 * sin(theta/2)) (1)**

For maximum coupling to an orbital shell of radius r, the fringe spacing
must match the orbital scale: d_fringe = r. Solving for the crossing
angle:

**theta = 2 * arcsin(lambda / (2 * r_orbital)) [Interference angle
formula --- derived from UFFT] (2)**

> *✓ Dimensional check: lambda [m] / r [m] = dimensionless argument
> of arcsin. Correct.*

This formula is derived directly from foam wave mechanics. It gives the
precise crossing angle at which two coherent beams create a standing
wave pattern that maximally couples to a given electron shell. Using the
soft X-ray wavelength matching the hydrogen n=1 orbital diameter (0.106
nm) as the base wavelength:

**Shell n=1: theta = 180° (beams head-on --- standing wave matches
innermost shell)**

**Shell n=2: theta = 28.96° (same wavelength, shallower crossing)**

**Shell n=3: theta = 12.76°**

**Shell n=4: theta = 7.17°**

> *✓ All angles calculated from theta = 2*arcsin(lambda_base /
> (2*n^2*a_0)). Confirmed numerically.*

Each angle couples the interference pattern to a different shell of the
same atom using the same frequency. Using a different frequency shifts
the entire set of angles. The formula provides a complete geometric
prescription for coupling to any shell of any element.

**IV. Multi-Frequency Combinations --- The UFFT Prediction**

A single frequency couples to one shell. A composite atom has multiple
shells at multiple scales. UFFT predicts that applying multiple
frequencies simultaneously --- each at the angle matched to its
corresponding shell --- should couple to the atom's complete foam
topology rather than one shell in isolation. The combined standing wave
pattern would resonate with the entire composite structure at once.

This is not yet systematically explored in physics literature.
Single-frequency spectroscopy and laser manipulation are well
established. The specific prediction from UFFT is that multi-frequency
beams at precisely calculated shell-matched angles produce qualitatively
stronger coupling than any single-frequency approach --- because the
intervention matches the full composite topology, not just one layer of
it.

>
> *~ This is a novel prediction derived from UFFT that requires

**V. The Honest Boundary --- Atomic vs Nuclear Manipulation**

At the atomic scale --- electron shells --- the required energies are eV
to keV range, corresponding to optical, ultraviolet, and soft X-ray
wavelengths. This regime is experimentally accessible and already
partially exploited in laser spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, laser
cooling, and attosecond physics. Atomic and molecular manipulation using
precise frequencies is established science. UFFT provides the geometric
framework for the angle dimension of that manipulation.

At the nuclear scale --- protons and neutrons at radii of ~10⁻¹⁵ m ---
the required wavelengths shrink to femtometres and the energies jump to
the MeV range. This is gamma ray territory. Nuclear excitation by photon
absorption is a real and active research area. But transmuting arbitrary
elements with electromagnetic frequency combinations alone has not been
experimentally demonstrated. The energy gap between atomic and nuclear
scales is approximately six orders of magnitude. This boundary is stated
honestly.

The following section examines whether the foam's void pressure can
bridge this gap --- providing the nuclear-scale energy from a stored
source while the resonant wave serves only as the trigger.
