## What This Theory Is

UFFT proposes the vacuum is a physical Planck-scale foam medium.

**Axiom Zero:** Every bubble displacement creates a paired void — *B + V = D*

From this single axiom, gravity, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, entanglement, dark matter, and propulsion mechanisms are derived. All equations are dimensionally verified.

## Two Hard Open Problems

*Updated February 2026. Previously three. The Koide parameter θ is no longer an independent open problem — see below.*

| Problem | Status |
|---|---|
| Fine structure constant α | The primary calculation. Closure condition of the D-mode coupling back to the B-V pair — derivable from foam geometry. Knot classification gives the particle spectrum; D-mode closure gives α. These are separate calculations. |
| Covariant vacuum density | Three-component coupled field (B-density, V-density, D-density). Needs QFT-in-curved-spacetime collaborator. **This single derivation unlocks three downstream results:** decoherence prediction precision (Part VIII), Bekenstein-Hawking entropy grounding (Part XIX), and running coupling constants from foam averaging (Part XIX). |

**Koide parameter θ = 0.222 rad — CLOSED as independent problem (February 2026)**

θ is α expressed as an angle in the three-dimensional B-V-D modal space of foam excitations. It is not a separate problem. It is the same problem in a different geometric language. When α is derived, θ is derived. See [Part XVIII, Section 3](19_part_xviii.md#section-3--what-the-hermetic-framework-implies-for-open-problems) for the full argument.

## Testable Predictions

| Prediction | Cost | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Decoherence altitude test (qubit coherence time vs. elevation) | Lab access | Months |
| Universal qubit-independence of decoherence change | Lab access | Months |
| Foam panel layer-count scaling (F ~ N coherent vs. F ~ √N incoherent) | Under $200 | Two weeks |
| Three-particle void-pair topology correlations | Formalisation pending | — |
