# PART II

**The Universe as Black Hole**

*A Direct Consequence of Axiom Zero*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

**Two Sides of One Displacement Event**

A black hole and a universe are the same displacement event D described
from opposite sides. From outside: total foam evacuation, infinite
density boundary, nothing escapes, event horizon at r_s = 2GM/c² where
foam density reaches zero. From inside: expanding spacetime, matter,
structure, time beginning at the discharge wavefront.

This resolves the black hole information paradox immediately.
Information falling into a black hole does not disappear. It becomes the
internal structure of the nested universe inside. Hawking radiation seen
from outside corresponds to the cosmic microwave background seen from
inside --- the same foam dynamics described from opposite perspectives
on the same event horizon.

**Nested Universes --- Infinite in Both Directions**

Every sufficiently massive black hole in our universe creates a
void-pair displacement of sufficient scale to seed a universe in the
layer below. Our universe exists inside a black hole in the layer above.
The nesting is infinite in both directions. Each level is governed by
the same Axiom Zero, the same void-pair conservation, the same
electrical discharge mechanism. The structure is self-similar at every
scale.

The question of what caused the Big Bang has a complete answer in UFFT:
a black hole formed in the parent layer. The void-pair of that black
hole is our universe. We exist because something collapsed somewhere
above us. And everything that collapses in our universe potentially
seeds something below.
