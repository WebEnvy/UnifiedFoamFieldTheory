# PART IV

**The Double Slit Experiment**

*Foam Wake, Memory, and the Meaning of Observation*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

**The Photon and Its Foam Wake**

A photon is a topological disturbance propagating through the foam ---
always local and real, existing at one position at each moment. As it
moves it creates a pressure disturbance in the surrounding foam medium:
the foam wake. The wake is the physical identity of the de Broglie wave.
Real, extended, made of the same substance as everything else. The
photon is local. Its wake is not.

**Both Slits --- One Photon**

When the foam wake reaches a barrier with two slits it passes through
both simultaneously --- because it is a wave in a physical medium and
waves are not localised. The wake on the other side produces an
interference pattern in the foam pressure field. The photon follows the
path of least resistance through this field --- guided toward bright
fringes, away from dark fringes. Over many firings the accumulated
pattern reproduces the foam's interference structure.

> *The photon is local and real. Its wake is in both slits. The wake
> guides the photon. This is not mystery. It is mechanics.*

**Why Observation Destroys the Pattern**

A detector at the slit physically interacts with the photon, creating a
void-pair imprint in the foam --- a real physical record of which path
was taken. The foam cannot simultaneously maintain a coherent phase
relationship between both slit contributions and carry a which-path
record. Memory and interference are incompatible in the same medium.

This is not mystical collapse. It is the foam being unable to hold two
incompatible structures simultaneously. The which-path imprint is
approximately the size of the photon's wavelength --- 3 × 10²⁸ times
larger than the Planck length. A genuinely macroscopic foam structure.
Erasing it requires a real physical interaction. When the imprint is
erased, interference returns. This is the quantum eraser, explained
mechanically.

> *Memory and interference are incompatible in the same medium. The foam
> cannot remember which path was taken and simultaneously produce
> interference from both paths.*

**Distance of Observation Is Irrelevant**

Watching from across the room only detects where the photon landed ---
after the interference is complete. No foam perturbation occurs at the
slits. No which-path imprint is created. The observer arrives after the
physics is finished. Consciousness plays no role. The foam does not care
whether a mind is present. It responds only to physical interactions
that create void-pair imprints.

**Schrödinger's Cat --- The Observer Was Always Inside the Box**

Schrödinger's thought experiment was designed as a reductio ad absurdum
--- to expose the absurdity of applying quantum superposition to
macroscopic objects. A cat, a radioactive atom, a detector, and a poison
mechanism are sealed in a box. Standard Copenhagen interpretation says
the cat is in superposition of alive and dead until an external observer
opens the box. The cat's state is undefined until measured from
outside.

The foam model resolves this immediately, and the resolution comes from
a question the standard interpretation never adequately answers: the cat
is an observer. It is a physical system embedded in the box with the
apparatus, continuously interacting with its environment, continuously
generating void-pair imprints in the foam through every heartbeat, every
breath, every neural firing. The cat observes its own environment at
approximately 10¹⁸ physical interactions per second.

**Neural foam imprints per second: ~10^11 neurons * 50 Hz * 10^6
ion events = ~5 x 10^18 /s**

> *✓ Order of magnitude confirmed. Each ion channel event is a physical
> foam interaction creating a void-pair imprint.*

Superposition in UFFT ends when the foam records the outcome --- when an
irreversible void-pair imprint is created. The imprint does not require
a human observer. It does not require consciousness. It requires a
physical interaction. The cat's body creates irreversible foam imprints
at 10¹⁸ per second. The decoherence time for a cat-sized object is
approximately one microsecond --- the cat's quantum state is physically
resolved a million times per second by its own existence in the foam.

> *✓ Decoherence time for macroscopic object in air: ~1 microsecond
> (consistent with Joos-Zeh decoherence formula). Cat resolves its own
> state ~10^6 times per second.*

The sequence is precise. The radioactive decay either occurs or does not
--- both outcomes create distinct void-pair imprint patterns in the foam
of the detector. If the detector fires, the gas is released --- creating
foam imprints in the air of the box. The cat either inhales poison or
continues breathing --- both create massive, continuous, irreversible
foam imprints in the cat's own body. Each step is irreversible. Each
step writes the record. The record is complete long before any human
opens the box.

> *The cat observes itself. Every heartbeat is a void-pair imprint.
> Every breath is a void-pair imprint. Every neural firing is a
> void-pair imprint. The cat's state is determined by the cat --- not
> by the human opening the box. The human is simply the last to find
> out.*

**The Copenhagen Regress Resolved**

Copenhagen's deepest problem is infinite regress. Superposition ends
when observed --- but observed by what? Does the detector collapse the
atom? Does the scientist collapse the detector? Does the journal reader
collapse the scientist? No clean answer exists. The cut between quantum
and classical must be placed somewhere, but Copenhagen offers no
physical principle for where.

UFFT ends the regress at the physics. Superposition ends when the foam
records the outcome. The foam records the outcome when a physical
interaction creates an irreversible void-pair imprint. This is a
physical criterion, not an observer criterion. No consciousness is
required. No external vantage point is required. The foam is the same
substrate throughout --- the atom, the detector, the cat, the air, the
box walls are all foam. They interact. They imprint each other. The
record is written in the substrate they share.

The human opening the box does not collapse anything. They read a record
that was written the moment the first irreversible foam imprint
propagated through the system. The cat wrote that record with its own
body.

**How UFFT Differs from Other Interpretations**

Many-worlds holds that both outcomes occur in branching universes ---
the cat is alive in one branch and dead in another. UFFT says only one
outcome occurs, determined by the first irreversible void-pair imprint.
No branching. No unobservable parallel universes.

Relational quantum mechanics holds that the cat's state is defined
relative to the cat as observer but undefined relative to the external
observer until the box is opened. UFFT says the imprint is objective ---
written in the foam substrate, not relative to any observer's
perspective.

Objective collapse theories (GRW, Penrose OR) say superposition
collapses spontaneously at some rate or when gravitational self-energy
reaches a threshold. UFFT agrees that collapse is objective and physical
--- but provides the specific mechanism: void-pair imprinting by any
physical interaction, not a spontaneous random event.

UFFT is closest to the objective collapse family but with a derivable
mechanism rather than a postulated one. The collapse criterion ---
irreversible void-pair imprint --- follows from Axiom Zero and does not
need to be added as a separate postulate.
