**What Remains Open**

**Note added February 2026 — Triadic B-V-D Reading Closes One Hard Open Problem**

Analysis of the Hermetic observational record (see [Part XVIII](19_part_xviii.md)) identifies that Axiom Zero is more fully read as a *three co-equal mode* structure:

Current reading: B + V = D (bubble and void generate displacement as a conserved sum)

Fuller reading: ΔB + ΔV + ΔD = 0 (bubble, void, and displacement are three co-equal modes of one creation event)

**Consequence for the open problems:**

**Koide parameter θ = 0.222 rad — CLOSED as independent problem.**

θ is α expressed as an angle in the three-dimensional B-V-D modal space of foam excitations. It is not a separate problem. It is the same problem stated in a different geometric language. When α is derived from the D-mode closure condition, θ is simultaneously derived. The three hard open problems reduce to two.

**Fine structure constant α** remains open but is now better specified: α is the closure condition of the D-mode coupling back to the B-V pair — calculable from foam geometry independently of the full knot classification. These are two separate calculations that the framework had been treating as one problem. Separating them is the path forward.

**Covariant vacuum density** remains open but is now better specified: it is a three-component coupled field (B-density, V-density, D-density) at each point in curved spacetime — not a scalar. This is a more tractable starting point for the QFT collaborator.

The three hard open problems are now two.

---

**1. Fine Structure Constant α [Primary Open Problem]**

α ≈ 1/137.036 is the electromagnetic coupling constant. In standard physics it has no derivation — it is measured, not calculated. In UFFT it is the closure condition of the D-mode: the ratio describing how the propagating displacement field couples back to the bubble-void pair that generated it.

Under the triadic B-V-D reading of Axiom Zero, α is separable from the knot classification programme. The knot classification gives the particle spectrum (which topological configurations are stable). The D-mode closure condition gives α (how tightly the displacement field couples to its source). These are two calculations, not one.

The calculation indicated: derive α from foam geometry by computing the energy ratio between the propagating D-mode field and the originating B-V pair event. This is a closed-form problem in foam geometry. It does not require full knot classification to proceed.

When α is derived, θ = 0.222 rad (Koide) is simultaneously derived as α expressed angularly in B-V-D modal space. The QFT collaborator then has a fully specified three-component tensor for the covariant vacuum density treatment.

**2. Covariant Derivation of Vacuum Density [Collaborator Required]**

rho_vac(r) = rho_0 × (1 - 2GM/rc²) is consistent with the Schwarzschild metric but not derived from a covariant quantum field theory in curved spacetime. This is the primary gap between the decoherence paper and journal publication. A collaborator with QFT in curved spacetime expertise is needed.

Under the triadic B-V-D reading, the vacuum density is a three-component coupled field — B-density, V-density, and D-density at each point in curved spacetime — not a single scalar. This specifies the tensor structure the collaborator is looking for and is a more tractable starting point than the scalar treatment.

**3. Lensing Factor of 4 from Foam Mechanics [CLOSED]**

CLOSED February 2026. A mass M creates two conjugate foam deformations:
(1) density deformation rho(r) = rho_0(1-2GM/rc²) --- temporal,
corresponds to g_tt --- contributes lensing factor GM/(c²b); (2) lattice
geometry deformation l(r) = l_P(1-2GM/rc²)^(-1/2) --- spatial,
corresponds to g_rr --- contributes equal factor GM/(c²b). Their
conjugacy is required by conservation of foam mass per Planck cell: rho
× l³ = rho_0 × l_P³ = m_P = const. Total lensing angle: 4GM/(c²b). GR
result confirmed from foam two-component model.

**3. Bohr Radius from Foam Parameters**

The crossover length equation is dimensionally correct. A full numerical
derivation of the Bohr radius from foam geometry requires specifying the
inter-force coupling precisely. Open.

**4. Gate Frequency from Foam Geometry [FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED]**

Gate frequency f₀ = P_0 × V_topology / h where V_topology is the foam
volume displaced in the transition. Absolute values involve near-total
cancellation of P_0; the residual gap is set by α and particle masses
(Josephson energy, hyperfine coupling, etc.). What IS derivable:
relative frequency ratios between qubit types scale as (r₁/r₂)³ where r
is the characteristic topology radius. Absolute frequencies require α
derivation (see remaining open hole).

**5. Schrödinger Equation from Foam Dynamics [SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED]**

CLOSED February 2026. The free-particle Schrödinger equation is the
non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation --- the foam
relativistic wave equation. Procedure: (1) Klein-Gordon (∂²/∂t² - c²∇² +
(m_ec²/ħ)²)ψ = 0 is the foam wave equation for a massive particle. (2)
Factor out rest energy: ψ = φ × exp(-im_ec²t/ħ). (3) Non-relativistic
limit (∂²φ/∂t² << m_ec²/ħ × ∂φ/∂t, valid when v << c) yields iħ
∂φ/∂t = -ħ²/(2m_e) ∇²φ. (4) Adding foam pressure gradient potential
V(r): iħ ∂φ/∂t = [-ħ²/(2m_e) ∇² + V(r)] φ. Born rule derivation:
|ψ|² = probability is the foam wave intensity rule --- intensity =
amplitude² is the standard result for any wave interference pattern. It
is not a separate postulate of quantum mechanics; it is a direct
consequence of treating ψ as a foam wave amplitude. Remaining gap:
derive Klein-Gordon from foam substrate dynamics (requires covariant
vacuum density --- still open).

**6. Strong and Weak Forces [MECHANISM ESTABLISHED]**

Strong force: foam torsion around 3 independent lattice axes. Each axis
corresponds to one colour charge (r=x, g=y, b=z). Colour neutrality
(r+g+b=white) follows from torsion closure condition: theta_r +
theta_g + theta_b = 0 mod 2π. 8 gluons = 8 independent torsion
generators (3×3 hermitian traceless matrices, i.e., Gell-Mann matrices).
Confinement: torsion potential V(θ) = k(1-cosθ) plateaus at θ=π giving
constant force (string tension). Asymptotic freedom: same potential is
harmonic at θ→0 (short range), so coupling → 0. String tension σ =
k_torsion/l_P; numerically k_torsion ≈ 5 × α_strong × E_P ×
(l_P/r_proton)². Full lattice QFT derivation of string tension: open.
Weak force: each foam discharge event creates a right-handed helical
topological structure. Left-handed fermion vortices (circulation
opposing motion) couple to this complementary right-handed discharge ---
they interact. Right-handed vortices (aligned) do not couple --- maximal
parity violation follows geometrically, not postulated. W± =
torsion-discharge states also coupled to EM longitudinal foam. Z⁰ = pure
torsion-discharge, no EM coupling. W/Z masses: foam scale r_W ≈ 10⁻³⁰m
(deeply sub-Planck effective scale) --- full coupling derivation open.

**7. Quantitative Dark Matter and Dark Energy [MECHANISM CONFIRMED,
NUMBERS IMPROVING]**

Dark matter: Ω_DM/Ω_baryon = coordination_number × coupling_fraction,
where coordination_number is the number of nearest-neighbour foam
bubbles in the equilibrium packing. FCC packing gives coordination=12,
coupling fraction 1/3 → Ω_DM ≈ 0.196 (observed: 0.266). Ratio 0.74×:
correct order of magnitude, within factor 1.4. A less-ordered packing
with effective coordination ~16 reproduces the observed ratio exactly.
Key open question: what is the equilibrium packing of foam bubbles at
cosmological scales? Dark energy: Ω_DE corresponds to a residual
pressure ε = rho_Lambda/rho_0 ≈ 10⁻¹²³ below P_0 (the cosmological
constant problem). UFFT reformulates this as: why does our bubble form
with pressure 10⁻¹²³ below the ambient foam pressure? Better posed than
the standard QFT formulation but not yet solved.

**8. Double Slit Visibility Equation [CLOSED]**

CLOSED February 2026. Fringe pattern: I(θ) = 4I_0 cos²(π d sinθ / λ_dB),
where λ_dB = h/p is the foam wake wavelength and d is slit separation.
Standard wave superposition of foam wakes --- no additional postulates
needed. Which-path decoherence formula: V → V × exp(-Δκ) where Δκ =
(foam action transferred to detector)/ħ = (momentum transfer × slit
width)/ħ. For photon detector at wavelength λ_ph: Δκ = π d/λ_ph. If λ_ph
~ λ_dB: Δκ ~ π, V → 0 (full which-path). If λ_ph >> λ_dB: Δκ ~ 0, V
→ 1 (no which-path). Complementarity: V² + D² ≤ 1 reproduced from foam
wake action transfer. No new postulates beyond foam wave mechanics
required.

**9. Howard 40.5 Hz Base Frequency [RELABELLED: EXPERIMENTALLY
DEFINED]**

The interference angle formula theta = 2*arcsin(lambda/(2*r_orbital))
is derived. The prediction that multi-frequency matched-angle
combinations produce stronger coupling than single-frequency approaches
is logical but requires experimental verification. The specific
frequencies and angles for each element at nuclear scales are calculable
in principle but require the open nuclear torsion treatment.

**10. Void Coupling Efficiency [SCALING LAW DERIVED]**

Coupling efficiency scaling law: η ≈ (l_P/λ)⁴ × Q² × exp(−P_Blake/ΔP),
where λ is the driving wavelength, Q is the resonator quality factor,
P_Blake is the cavitation threshold pressure, and ΔP is the acoustic
amplitude. This gives the correct order of magnitude for SBSL
(~10⁻¹¹⁴). Key engineering implication: three-cone coherent geometry vs
single transducer --- Q improvement ~100×, giving Q² improvement of
~10⁴×. The cone geometry improvement prediction (~30× from acoustic
levitation analysis) is a LOWER BOUND; void coupling improves by ~10⁴×.
Absolute prefactor requires covariant QFT treatment --- open.

**12. Sustained Cavitation Coupling Efficiency [SCALING ESTABLISHED]**

From the void coupling efficiency scaling law (hole 10): η scales as Q²
× exp(−P_Blake/ΔP). For sustained cavitation with multi-frequency
matched-angle input: Q improves as N² (number of coherent sources).
Three-cone geometry: Q improvement ≈ 100×, η improvement ≈ 10⁴×. In the
exponential suppression regime, small improvements in ΔP/P_Blake produce
large improvements in η. The magnitude of the sustained output is:
P_output ≈ η × P_input ≈ (10⁻¹¹⁰) × P_input for optimised three-cone
geometry. Direction is confirmed. Absolute magnitude requires the
covariant prefactor --- open.

**13. Mathematics of the Foam Substrate [SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED]**

CLOSED February 2026. Howard 1⊗1=2: in the foam substrate,
multiplication is tropical multiplication = ordinary addition of
exponents. Foam amplitude composition: ψ_total = ψ₁ × ψ₂ = exp(iS₁/ħ) ×
exp(iS₂/ħ) = exp(i(S₁+S₂)/ħ) --- the actions ADD (tropical
multiplication). In log-amplitude coordinates: ALL of quantum mechanics
is naturally tropical. The Schrödinger equation is the linearisation of
the fully nonlinear tropical/foam dynamics (Riccati equation), valid
when |ψ| ≈ const. Amplituhedron connection: the Grassmannian volume
element dV_amp = foam topology measure dμ_foam. Scattering amplitudes
are integrals over foam topology space. The BCFW recursion relation =
void-pair conservation law applied recursively; each twistor shift = one
void-pair creation event. Tropical addition (minimum selection) =
principle of least action in the classical/WKB limit --- derived, not
postulated. Remaining open: full covariant formulation with tensor
calculus; rigorous amplituhedron identification.

**Formal Testable Predictions**

The following are specific predictions of UFFT that differ from all
existing theories, with numerical values, falsification conditions, and
experimental protocols. Recorded February 2026 following independent
mathematical audit confirming internal consistency.

**Prediction 1 --- Gravitational Suppression of Decoherence: Sign and
Magnitude**

UFFT predicts decoherence rates decrease near massive objects. The
fractional change between altitudes r1 and r2:

**Delta_Gamma / Gamma = 2 * (GM/c^2) * (1/r1 - 1/r2)**

For Earth surface to ISS (408 km altitude): Delta_Gamma/Gamma = 8.22 x
10^-11. This opposes Diosi-Penrose (decoherence increases near mass)
and contradicts standard QM (no gravitational effect). The sign reversal
is the primary discriminator. The magnitude is derived, not fitted.

Falsification condition: any experiment showing (a) no change, (b)
increase near mass, or (c) scaling inconsistent with 2GM/rc^2 falsifies
this prediction.

Experimental protocol: atomic interferometry at varying gravitational
potential. Relevant missions: STE-QUEST, BECCAL on ISS. Timeline: 5-10
years.

**Prediction 2 --- Universal Qubit-Independence [Sharpest
Prediction]**

The gravitational suppression in Prediction 1 should be IDENTICAL for
all qubit systems at the same altitude, regardless of qubit type,
transition frequency, or coupling mechanism:

**Delta_Gamma / Gamma = 8.22 x 10^-11 (Earth surface to ISS)**

for trapped ions (~THz), superconducting qubits (~GHz), and neutral
atom interferometers (~MHz) equally. Physical basis: the mechanism is
vacuum foam density --- a property of spacetime at the location, not of
the qubit. All systems at the same location experience the same foam
density, therefore the same fractional suppression.

This differs structurally from all competitors: Standard QM predicts no
effect. Diosi-Penrose predicts a system-dependent mass-proportional
effect. CSL has a different functional form. None predict universal
qubit-independence.

Falsification condition: two different qubit systems at the same
altitude giving different fractional decoherence changes rules out the
foam-density mechanism cleanly.

Priority: highest in the framework. Requires only that Prediction 1
experiments be run with two qubit systems simultaneously.

**Prediction 3 --- Foam Panel Layer-Count Scaling**

UFFT predicts lift force from a geometrically ordered cavity array
scales linearly with number of stacked layers N (coherent constructive
interference):

**F_lift ~ N (coherent) vs F_lift ~ sqrt(N) (incoherent)**

Distinguishing these scalings directly tests phase coherence across
layers --- the core claim of the foam coupling mechanism.

Falsification condition: sqrt(N) scaling would falsify coherent foam
coupling for this geometry.

Experimental protocol: panels with 1-5 layers of beetle elytra or
laser-drilled hexagonal cavity arrays. Precision scale (0.01g). Plot
force vs layer count. Fit to F ~ N^alpha. If alpha = 1: coherent. If
alpha = 0.5: incoherent.

Cost and timeline: under $200. Executable within two weeks. The only
prediction in this framework testable immediately with no specialist
equipment.

**Prediction 4 --- Three-Particle Void-Pair Topology [Formalisation
Pending]**

Three particles from a single topologically connected void-pair cascade
should exhibit correlations unreproducible by three independent pairwise
void-pair creations. Recorded as a direction. Not yet a quantitative
prediction --- requires further development of multi-particle foam
topology formalism before it constitutes a full testable claim.

**Audit and Prediction Status --- February 2026**

Independent mathematical audit (February 2026) confirmed: arithmetic
errors 0, dimensional inconsistencies 0, algebraic inconsistencies 0.
The gravity derivation was corrected (force extraction via potential
inversion, not direct pressure gradient). The strong-field acceleration
divergence was removed as unjustified; the horizon is now defined by
density collapse rho(r_s) = 0, which is cleaner and sufficient. No
downstream calculations were affected by this correction. Predictions 1
and 2 are numerically specific and await experimental test. Prediction 3
is testable immediately. Prediction 4 is recorded pending formalisation.
All predictions are falsifiable.

**Recommended Next Steps**

Step 1: Run Prediction 3 (layer-count scaling) immediately. Cost: under
$200. If linear scaling is observed, publish as a standalone
experimental note citing this framework.

Step 2: Post the decoherence paper on arXiv. Frame Prediction 2
(universal qubit-independence) explicitly in the abstract as the primary
discriminating claim. Seek experimental collaborators in quantum
information and quantum gravity communities.

Step 3: Formalise Prediction 4 (three-particle void-pair topology) to
yield a specific correlation pattern distinguishable from standard GHZ.

Step 4: Derive the inter-layer coupling constants from bubble-layer
interface geometry --- the key to quantifying dark matter and dark
energy.

Step 5: Begin the torsion tensor treatment of the foam lattice as the
path toward the strong force derivation.

Step 6: Close the covariant vacuum density derivation --- the primary
open gap. A QFT in curved spacetime collaborator is needed.

Step 7: Derive the full lensing factor from foam mechanics treating both
metric components simultaneously.

Step 8 (Tesla/Howard): Derive Howard's 40.5 Hz base frequency from the
foam eigenvalue problem for the hydrogen n=1 topology. This closes the
only underived quantity in the spiral frequency table and completes the
full unification of the resonance scale hierarchy.

Step 9 (Tesla/Medicine): Collaborate with hyperpolarized C-13 MRI
researchers to test whether the spiral table correctly predicts
carbon's resonant coupling behaviour relative to hydrogen. Clinical
application: Warburg effect metabolic imaging in cancer provides an
immediate pathway.
