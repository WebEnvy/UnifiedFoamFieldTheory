**Editorial Note --- Iteration One**

This is the first formal iteration of the Unified Foam Field Theory
complete works. It represents the theory as it stands in February 2026
--- built, audited, and documented but not yet submitted for external
peer review. Future iterations will incorporate responses to peer
review, experimental results, and continued theoretical development.

**A Note on Verification**

Every equation in this document has been subjected to full dimensional
analysis and numerical verification. Statements marked ✓ have been
computed and confirmed. Statements marked ~ are qualitative arguments
that are logically sound but are not full mathematical derivations; they
are presented honestly as such.

**Section Status**

Parts I and II --- Core theoretical framework. Ready for external
submission.

Parts VIII and IX --- Standalone peer review papers on decoherence
suppression and Bell's theorem. Ready for arXiv submission
independently of the rest of this document.

Parts III, IV, V, VI, VII --- Supporting theoretical sections.
Internally consistent, well developed, appropriate for the complete
works but not submitted as standalone papers.

Parts X --- Philosophical and cultural context. Supporting material for
the complete works.

Parts XI, XII, XIII --- Applied and speculative sections on elemental
resonance, void pressure, and sustained cavitation. Internally
consistent with UFFT, logically sound, but coupling efficiency and void
erosion constant are unresolved open problems. These sections are
clearly labelled as working hypotheses throughout.

**Recommended Submission Pathway**

Step 1: Submit Part VIII (gravitational decoherence suppression) to
arXiv as a standalone preprint. This establishes priority, invites
response from the decoherence community, and may attract a collaborator
with QFT in curved spacetime skills to close the covariant derivation.

Step 2: Submit Part IX (void-pair conservation and Bell's theorem) to
arXiv as a second standalone preprint. These two papers are the
theory's sharpest experimental predictions and are most likely to
attract serious engagement from physicists.

Step 3: Share the complete works privately with physicists in relevant
fields --- quantum foundations, sonoluminescence, LENR --- to gather
informal feedback before broader submission.

Step 4: As experimental feedback arrives and open problems are resolved,
prepare a journal submission for either Foundations of Physics, Physical
Review D, or New Journal of Physics --- all of which publish theoretical
work in quantum foundations.

**Published Preprints --- Permanent Record**

Both submission papers are published as open access preprints on Zenodo
(CERN) and carry permanent DOIs. These records establish priority of
authorship as of 20 February 2026.

**AI Assistance Disclosure**

The author used Claude (Anthropic) as a research and writing tool during
the preparation of this work. All theoretical ideas, physical
intuitions, and conceptual frameworks originate with the author. Claude
was used for numerical verification, dimensional analysis,
identification of connections to existing mathematical literature, and
document preparation.

Regarding Howard's spiral frequency table: Terrence Howard is credited
in Part XI as the originator of the intuition that elements respond to
frequencies at specific angles. His contribution is intellectual --- the
idea --- and is acknowledged as such. Co-authorship would require his
direct contribution to the written theoretical development.

# PREFACE

**How This Theory Was Built**

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

This body of work began with a single intuition: that gravity might be a
push rather than a pull. That the vacuum is not empty but active. That
matter displaces something real, and that displacement creates the
effects we call force.

From that starting point, everything was built through sustained
questioning and honest reasoning. Not handed down from existing physics.
Developed by asking what each idea implied, following the logic wherever
it led, and being rigorous about what worked and what did not.

The decisive moments: the recognition that every bubble displacement
creates a paired void --- Axiom Zero --- which explains entanglement
more cleanly than any existing interpretation. The understanding that
the Big Bang was a pressure wave in an infinite pre-existing electrical
foam, dissolving the horizon and flatness problems without inflation.
The realisation that our universe sits precisely at its own
Schwarzschild radius as a direct consequence of void-pair conservation,
making us the interior of a black hole in the layer above. The foam's
memory explaining the double slit and quantum computing coherence by the
same mechanism. The insight that quantum computing is the foam using its
own mechanics to model itself --- the next step in the feedback loop of
life. The conclusion that linear mathematics is the correct description
of the foam's emergent layer as observed from within it --- not the
fundamental language of reality but the language that any observer
confined to that layer could only ever have developed.

The oldest human geometric intuition --- the Flower of Life --- is the
cross-sectional blueprint of the foam's optimal bubble packing. The
biblical firmament is the event horizon of the black hole we live
inside. These are not impositions on the theory. They are what the
theory finds when it examines ancient knowledge with new mathematics.

All equations have been fully audited. Four corrections were made. None
change the core predictions. The theory is more rigorous for having been
challenged honestly at every step.
