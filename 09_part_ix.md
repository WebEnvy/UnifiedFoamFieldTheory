# PART IX

**Peer Review Paper**

*Void-Pair Conservation as the Physical Mechanism of Quantum
Entanglement*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

**Abstract**

> *We propose that quantum entanglement is the physical manifestation of
> void-pair conservation in a quantized vacuum foam. A displacement
> event D --- the creation of one bubble and one complementary void ---
> is the fundamental ontological object. The bubble and void are two
> addresses of one event, not two correlated objects. This model escapes
> Bell's theorem because D is inherently non-local and resists the
> factorization Bell's proof requires. The antipodal symmetry of the
> void-pair selects the quantum singlet state, which produces the
> experimentally confirmed correlation E(a,b) = -cos(theta). A testable
> prediction for three-particle connected foam topologies is proposed.*

**1. Void-Pair Conservation and Bell's Theorem**

Axiom Zero: B(x) + V(x') = D. D cannot be factored into local parts at
x and x'. Bell's theorem requires the correlation function to be
writable as:

**E(a,b) = integral A(a,lambda)*B(b,lambda)*rho(lambda)*d(lambda)
(1)**

where lambda is a local hidden variable. The displacement event D is not
local --- it is defined by its extension between both endpoints
simultaneously. The factorization cannot be applied. The foam escapes
Bell not by finding a flaw in it but by providing an ontological
category that Bell's proof was not designed to test.

Numerical confirmation: a classical local hidden variable model with
antipodal structure gives a triangular correlation function E_LHV = 1 -
2*theta/pi, differing from -cos(theta) by up to 0.207. This is the
experimentally ruled-out region. The foam model uses the quantum
singlet, not the classical approximation.

**2. The Singlet State from Antipodal Symmetry**

The void is the antipodal complement of the bubble in every direction.
The unique two-particle state satisfying perfect anti-correlation in
every measurement direction simultaneously:

**|D> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (|up,down> - |down,up>) (2)**

Selected by symmetry, not assigned arbitrarily. From it:

**E(a,b) = <D|(sigma_a x sigma_b)|D> = -cos(theta_ab) (3)**

> *✓ Evaluated at 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180° --- matches quantum
> mechanical prediction exactly.*

**3. Testable Prediction**

For three particles created from a connected three-way foam topology,
void-pair conservation predicts correlations differing from the standard
GHZ prediction. Testable with existing multi-photon entanglement
experiments --- a specific experimental preparation not yet performed.

**4. Conclusion**

The void-pair model provides the physical reason quantum entangled
states are non-separable: they describe one object --- the displacement
event D --- not two correlated objects. The singlet state is selected by
the void-pair's antipodal symmetry. The correct quantum correlations
follow. The question quantum mechanics answers is what are the
correlations. The void-pair model answers what is the physical thing
being described.
