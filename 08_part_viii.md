**1. Introduction**

The Diosi-Penrose model predicts a decoherence rate that increases with
local gravitational field strength. We examine the opposite prediction:
if local vacuum density decreases near massive objects, the rate of
vacuum-induced decoherence decreases near mass. The two models differ by
a sign in the gravitational correction term. That sign difference is
experimentally distinguishable.

**2. Theoretical Framework**

**2.1 Vacuum Density**

**rho_vac(r) = rho_0 * (1 - 2GM/(r*c^2)) (1)**

> *Factor of 2 verified: rho_vac = 0 at r = r_s = 2GM/c². Consistent
> with Schwarzschild metric.*

**2.2 Position-Dependent Decoherence Rate**

**Gamma(r) = Gamma_0 * (1 - 2GM/(r*c^2)) (2)**

**tau(r) = tau_0 / (1 - 2GM/(r*c^2)) (3)**

**2.3 Comparison with Diosi-Penrose**

**Gamma_VD(r)/Gamma_VD(inf) = 1 - 2GM/(r*c^2) [This model: suppressed
near mass]**

**Gamma_DP(r)/Gamma_DP(inf) = 1 + GM/(r*c^2) [Diosi-Penrose: enhanced
near mass]**

The difference between model predictions is 3GM/rc² --- a sign
difference observable with next-generation space atom interferometers.

**3. Experimental Protocol**

Measure decoherence time tau at gravitational potential phi_1. Repeat at
phi_2. Compute the ratio R = tau(r_2)/tau(r_1) = (1 - 2*phi_1)/(1 -
2*phi_2). This model predicts R > 1 for phi_2 < phi_1 (higher
altitude = longer coherence). Diosi-Penrose predicts R < 1. One model
must be wrong. Effect magnitude at Earth surface versus ISS:
approximately 8 × 10⁻¹¹. Within reach of BECCAL and STE-QUEST platforms.

**4. Conclusion**

The vacuum foam density model predicts gravitational suppression of
decoherence --- opposite in sign to Diosi-Penrose. The sign difference
is unambiguous and forms the basis of a clean experimental
discrimination using existing space-based atom interferometry
technology.
