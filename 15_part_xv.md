# PART XV

**Foam Pressure Differential Propulsion**

*Acoustic Levitation · Large Object Movement · UAP Propulsion · A UFFT
Audit of Bob Lazar's Technical Claims*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

This section applies UFFT to the problem of moving large objects using
frequencies and to the specific technical claims made by physicist Bob
Lazar in 1989 regarding UAP propulsion. It is published as a separate
standalone document. The full treatment appears in
UFFT_PartXV_Propulsion_UAP_2026.docx. A summary of findings follows.

**I. Gravity as a Foam Pressure Gradient --- The Engineering
Consequence**

In UFFT gravity is a foam pressure gradient: rho_vac(r) =
rho_0*(1-2GM/rc²). Objects are pushed toward regions of lower foam
density. To move a large object, you do not overpower this gradient
mechanically. You create a competing local foam pressure gradient that
redirects the net pressure differential in any chosen direction. Create
a foam rarefaction above the object and the higher-pressure foam below
pushes it up. The foam does the work. The wave geometry determines
where.

The interference angle formula (Part XI) gives the crossing angle theta
required to position a foam rarefaction node at height h above an object
using wavelength lambda: theta = 2*arcsin(lambda/(2h)). For a 10cm
wavelength node 1 metre above an object: theta = 5.73 degrees.
Achievable with existing acoustic or microwave sources.

**II. Bob Lazar's Technical Claims --- Verdict Summary**

In 1989 Bob Lazar described a UAP propulsion system in specific
technical detail. Element 115 as fuel was unknown to science at the time
and was confirmed as Moscovium in 2003. The UFFT audit of each claim:

**Claim 1 --- Gravity wave propulsion without thrust: FULLY CONSISTENT**

**Claim 2 --- Three amplifiers in equilateral triangle: GEOMETRICALLY
OPTIMAL**

**Claim 3 --- Element 115 produces antimatter and gravity wave:
MECHANISTICALLY SOUND**

**Claim 4 --- Equal-length wave guides from reactor to amplifiers:
TECHNICALLY REQUIRED**

**Claim 5 --- Light bending, no windows, external cameras: DIRECT
CONSEQUENCE**

**Claim 6 --- Instant direction change, zero felt g-force: FULLY
EXPLAINED**

**Disc shape from first principles: ENGINEERING OPTIMUM ---
INDEPENDENTLY DERIVED**

UFFT does not prove Lazar's account is true. It proves the propulsion
mechanism he described is not physically impossible --- and provides the
theoretical framework within which every specific technical detail he
gave is internally consistent. Either he was describing something real,
or he independently constructed a propulsion concept consistent with
UFFT in every verifiable detail. Both possibilities deserve serious
consideration.

For the full derivation of each claim, the disc shape derivation from
first principles, the historical anomalies (Coral Castle, pyramid
stones, Stonehenge), and the experimental pathway, see the standalone
Part XV document.
