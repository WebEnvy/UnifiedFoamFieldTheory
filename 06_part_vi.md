# PART VI

**The Correspondence Principle**

*How UFFT Degrades to Linear Mathematics*

**Luke Martin**

*Independent Researcher | 2026*

For any physical theory to be viable it must reproduce established
theories in their domains of validity. UFFT is built on non-linear foam
dynamics. Standard physics is predominantly linear. This requires that
the foam's non-linearity disappears at scales where linear physics has
been verified, and survives only where current theories are already
known to fail.

**I. Gravity: Non-Linear → Newton [Proven]**

The full foam acceleration: a = -(GM/r²) · 1/(1 - 2GM/rc²). Taylor
expanding for x = 2GM/rc² << 1: the leading term is exactly Newton's
law. Higher terms are suppressed by powers of x.

> classical measurement precision.*

The foam degrades to Newton with mathematical precision in the weak
field limit. This is not approximate. It is exact in the limit x → 0.

**II. Quantum Mechanics: Non-Linear Foam → Linear QM [Qualitative
argument]**

A quantum measurement at scale lambda involves a foam region containing:

**N_bubbles ~ (lambda / l_Planck)^3 (1)**

Non-linear bubble interactions average out over this ensemble. The
suppression of non-linear corrections:

**epsilon ~ (l_Planck / lambda)^2 (2)**

> *✓ At atomic scale (lambda = 1e-10 m): epsilon = (1.62e-35 / 1e-10)^2
> = 2.6e-50*
>
> *✓ At quantum optics scale (lambda = 1e-9 m): epsilon = 2.6e-52*

Non-linear corrections to quantum mechanics are suppressed by 10⁻⁵⁰ at
atomic scales. This is consistent with why no deviation from linear
quantum mechanics has ever been observed --- the deviation is 50 orders
of magnitude below any conceivable measurement sensitivity.

> from foam mechanics --- that is open work.*

**III. Where Non-Linearity Legitimately Survives**

**A. Near the Schwarzschild Radius [Proven]**

As r → r_s = 2GM/c², the non-linearity parameter x = 2GM/rc² → 1. The
Taylor expansion fails. The vacuum density approaches zero --- the foam
ceases to exist at r_s. This is precisely where GR and quantum mechanics
are known to be incompatible. The foam predicts that the breakdown of
linear physics near a black hole is a feature --- the full non-linear
substrate is required and linear quantum field theory is insufficient.

> *✓ Divergence of acceleration at r_s confirmed analytically.*

**B. At the Planck Scale [By definition]**

At lambda = l_Planck, epsilon = 1. Non-linear corrections are of the
same magnitude as linear terms. The thermodynamic averaging argument
fails completely. Full non-linear foam dynamics operate. This is the
regime of quantum gravity --- where all current theories are inadequate.
UFFT predicts non-linearity precisely where non-linearity is expected.

**C. At Ultra-High Energies [Quantified, currently undetectable]**

**epsilon_energy ~ (E / E_Planck)^2 (3)**

> *✓ LHC energy / Planck energy = 1.06e-15. Non-linear correction at LHC
> = 1.13e-30. Completely undetectable but precisely defined.*

At energies approaching the Planck scale, deviations from linear quantum
field theory should appear. Current accelerators are 15 orders of
magnitude below this threshold. Future Planck-scale experiments would
test this prediction directly.

**IV. The Correspondence Summary**

Three non-linearity parameters, each small wherever linear physics
works, each approaching 1 precisely where current physics fails:

**epsilon_gravity = 2GM/(r*c^2) [small in weak fields]**

**epsilon_quantum = (l_Planck/lambda)^2 [small at scales >>
l_Planck]**

**epsilon_energy = (E/E_Planck)^2 [small at sub-Planck energies]**

> *UFFT is non-linear at its foundation and linear in all the places
> where linear physics works. The non-linearity survives precisely where
> current physics already knows it must.*
